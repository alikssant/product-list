## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Responsive Design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Component-based architecture

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my layout skills using both CSS Grid and Flexbox. I learned how to:

- Structure a responsive 3-column layout and adjust it fluidly up to 1024px and beyond.
- Design a sticky cart panel that integrates smoothly with a dynamically updating product list.
- Manage React component state effectively for cart item count, adding/removing products, and order resetting.
- Improve the modularity of my code by splitting components like buttons and cards into their own files for better maintainability.

### Continued development

- Persistence with localStorage so the cart doesnâ€™t reset on refresh
- Animations on cart interactions
- Accessibility improvements like keyboard navigation and ARIA roles
